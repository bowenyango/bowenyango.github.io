11:T4ad,The query message also includes the IP address and link-layer address of the sending host. Thus, when a host broadcasts a query message, each host on the network can learn the sender’s link-level and IP addresses and place that information in its ARP table. However, not every host adds this information to its ARP table. If the host already has an entry for that host in its table, it “refreshes” this entry; that is, it resets the length of time until it discards the entry. If that host is the target of the query, then it adds the information about the sender to its table, even if it did not already have an entry for that host. This is because there is a good chance that the source host is about to send it an application-level message, and it may eventually have to send a response or ACK back to the source; it will need the source’s physical address to do this. If a host is not the target and does not already have an entry for the source in its ARP table, then it does not add an entry for the source. This is because there is no reason to believe that this host will ever need the source’s link-level address; there is no need to clutter its ARP table with this information.2:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"headline\":\"IP\",\"datePublished\":\"2024-10-31T00:00:00.000Z\",\"dateModified\":\"2024-10-31T00:00:00.000Z\",\"description\":\"Explores the concepts of IP.\",\"image\":\"/static/images/logo-round.png\",\"url\":\"https://codewisdom.io/blog/systems-and-networking/networking/basic-concepts/ip\",\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Bowen Y\"}]}"}}],["$","section",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 sm:px-6 xl:max-w-5xl xl:px-0","children":[["$","$Le",null,{}],["$","article",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"xl:divide-y xl:divide-gray-200 xl:dark:divide-gray-700","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"pt-6 xl:pb-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-1 text-center","children":[["$","dl",null,{"className":"space-y-10","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","dt",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"Published on"}],["$","dd",null,{"className":"text-base font-medium leading-6 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400","children":["$","time",null,{"dateTime":"2024-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","children":"Wednesday, October 30, 2024"}]}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-4xl sm:leading-10 md:text-5xl md:leading-14","children":"IP"}]}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid-rows-[auto_1fr] divide-y divide-gray-200 pb-8 dark:divide-gray-700 xl:grid xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-6 xl:divide-y-0","children":[["$","dl",null,{"className":"pb-10 pt-6 xl:border-b xl:border-gray-200 xl:pt-11 xl:dark:border-gray-700","children":[["$","dt",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"Authors"}],["$","dd",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4 sm:space-x-12 xl:block xl:space-x-0 xl:space-y-8","children":[["$","li","Bowen Y",{"className":"flex items-center space-x-2","children":[["$","$Lf",null,{"src":"/static/images/pixel-avatar.png","width":38,"height":38,"alt":"avatar","className":"h-10 w-10 rounded-full"}],["$","dl",null,{"className":"whitespace-nowrap text-sm font-medium leading-5","children":[["$","dt",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"Name"}],["$","dd",null,{"className":"text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100","children":"Bowen Y"}],["$","dt",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"Twitter"}],["$","dd",null,{"children":"$undefined"}]]}]]}]]}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"divide-y divide-gray-200 dark:divide-gray-700 xl:col-span-3 xl:row-span-2 xl:pb-0","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose max-w-none pb-8 pt-10 dark:prose-invert","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"content-header","id":"ip-header","children":[["$","a",null,{"className":"break-words","href":"#ip-header","aria-hidden":"true","tabIndex":"-1","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"content-header-link","children":["$","svg",null,{"className":"h-5 linkicon w-5","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":[["$","path",null,{"d":"M12.232 4.232a2.5 2.5 0 0 1 3.536 3.536l-1.225 1.224a.75.75 0 0 0 1.061 1.06l1.224-1.224a4 4 0 0 0-5.656-5.656l-3 3a4 4 0 0 0 .225 5.865.75.75 0 0 0 .977-1.138 2.5 2.5 0 0 1-.142-3.667l3-3Z"}],["$","path",null,{"d":"M11.603 7.963a.75.75 0 0 0-.977 1.138 2.5 2.5 0 0 1 .142 3.667l-3 3a2.5 2.5 0 0 1-3.536-3.536l1.225-1.224a.75.75 0 0 0-1.061-1.06l-1.224 1.224a4 4 0 1 0 5.656 5.656l3-3a4 4 0 0 0-.225-5.865Z"}]]}]}]}],"IP Header"]}],["$","p",null,{"children":["$","img",null,{"alt":"ip-format","src":"/assets/ip-format.png"}]}],["$","ol",null,{"children":["$","li",null,{"children":"Version (4 bits):"}]}],["$","ul",null,{"children":["$","li",null,{"children":"Specifies the IP version.
