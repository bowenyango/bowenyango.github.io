      <description>Skip CI for a specific push # By default, CircleCI automatically triggers a pipeline whenever you push changes to your project. You can override this behavior by adding one of the following tags within the first 250 characters of the body or title of the latest commit you pushed:
[ci skip]
[skip ci]
Adding one of these tags skips pipeline execution for all the commits included in the push.</description>

      <description># In CircleCI, the save_cache step allows you to cache dependencies or other directories between jobs. The scope of a cache in CircleCI is at the repository level, but its applicability can be fine-tuned using keys that may include branch names, environment variables, or other parameters. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works:</description>

      <description>CircleCI Workspace # What Exactly Are CircleCI Workspaces? # CircleCI Workspaces allow you to share files and directories between jobs within a workflow. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to note that Workspaces are not the same as caching or artifactsâ€”they serve a unique role. Workspaces are mutable; you can add data to them as jobs progress through the workflow. Think of it as a temporary storage unit that multiple jobs within a single workflow can access and modify.</description>
