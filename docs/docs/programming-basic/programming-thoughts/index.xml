      <description>Service Code and Database Schema Synchronization in Production Environment # To ensure that your microservices on AWS ECS and your database schema updates are synchronized effectively without causing service disruptions or inconsistencies, you can consider the following approaches:
1. Implement a Blue-Green Deployment Strategy # Useful when the databases and code are not backward/forward compatible.
Prepare a Green environment with the new code and the updated schema while the Blue environment continues to run the old code and schema.</description>

      <description>Monolithic VS Microservice # In a monolithic architecture, the components interact directly within a single application instance, often sharing data in-memory or through internal function calls.
In contrast, in a microservices architecture, different services are typically deployed on separate servers or environments and communicate through network calls, often using HTTP requests.
Scalability # Monolithic`: Scaling requires scaling the entire application, even if only one part of the application needs more resources.</description>
