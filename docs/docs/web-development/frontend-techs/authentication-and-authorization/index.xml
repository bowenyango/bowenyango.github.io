      <description>What is callback URL? # A callback URL is a web address that an application will redirect to after a certain event has occurred, often with some additional data. This is a common pattern in web development, especially in scenarios involving authentication, webhooks, or integrating third-party services.
For example, when you log into a website using a third-party service (like logging into a site with your Google account), after successful authentication, Google will redirect you back to the original website using a callback URL provided by that website.</description>

      <description>What is Cookie? # A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user&amp;rsquo;s computer by the user&amp;rsquo;s web browser while the user is browsing.
Cookies are used to remember information about the user for the duration of the visit (session cookies) or for repeat visits (persistent cookies). They can store preferences, session information, and other data to improve the user experience or track user behavior.</description>

      <description>What is JWT? # JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
JWTs are commonly used for authorization and information exchange. They can encode user credentials and are often used in token-based authentication systems.
JWTs are secure because they can be digitally signed. However, they should be transmitted securely and stored safely. Since JWTs can contain sensitive information, they should not be exposed to untrusted environments.</description>

      <description>What is Session? # A session is a server-side storage of information that is related to a particular user or browser.
Sessions are used to persist user data across multiple HTTP requests. When a session is started, the server creates a unique identifier (session ID) which is typically passed back to the browser via a cookie.
The main security concern is session hijacking. Protecting the session ID, especially in transit (using HTTPS), is critical.</description>
